# NetworkRequester

NetworkRequester is an HTTP Combine-only networking library.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13.0+
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5.3+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

NetworkRequester supports only SPM and adding it as a dependency is done just by including the URL into the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/igashev/NetworkRequester.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "1.2.0")
    )
]
```
Or by using the integrated tool of Xcode.

## Usage

### Building requests

NetworkRequester provides a very easy way to build a request using `URLRequestBuilder`.
```swift
// Creating a builder
let requestBuilder = URLRequestBuilder(
    environment: Environment.production,
    endpoint: UsersEndpoint.users,
    httpMethod: .get,
    httpHeaders: [
        .json, 
        .authorization(bearerToken: "secretBearerToken")
    ],
    httpBody: nil,
    queryParameters: nil
)
```

### Calling requests

There are two options with which to make the actual network request.

The first option is using plain `URLRequest`.
```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let name: String
}

struct BackendError: DecodableError {
    let errorCode: Int
    let localizedError: String
}

let url = URL(string: "https://amazingapi.com/v1/users")!
let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url)

let caller = AsyncCaller(decoder: JSONDecoder())
let user: User = try await caller.call(
    using: urlRequest, 
    errorType: BackendError.self
)
```

The second option is using `URLRequestBuilder`.
```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let name: String
}

struct BackendError: DecodableError {
    let errorCode: Int
    let localizedError: String
}

let requestBuilder = URLRequestBuilder(
    environment: "https://amazingapi.com",
    endpoint: "v1/users",
    httpMethod: .get,
    httpHeaders: [
        .json, 
        .authorization(bearerToken: "secretBearerToken")
    ],
    httpBody: nil,
    queryParameters: nil
)

let caller = AsyncCaller(decoder: JSONDecoder())
let user: User = try await caller.call(
    using: requestBuilder, 
    errorType: BackendError.self
)
```
Take into account that when a response data is expected, a type that conforms to `Encodable` should be specified as `Output`. Otherwise `Void`.
