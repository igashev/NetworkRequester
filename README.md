## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13.0+
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5.3+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

NetworkRequester supports only SPM and adding it as a dependency is done just by including the URL into the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/igashev/NetworkRequester.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.2.0"))
]
```
Or by using the integrated tool of Xcode.

## Usage

### Building requests

NetworkRequester provides a very easy way to build a request using `URLRequestBuilder`.
```swift
// Creating a builder
let requestBuilder = URLRequestBuilder(
    environment: Environment.production,
    endpoint: UsersEndpoint.users,
    httpMethod: .get,
    httpHeaders: [.json, .authorization(bearerToken: "secretBearerToken")],
    httpBody: nil,
    queryParameters: nil
)

// Building a URLRequest
do {
    let urlRequest = try requestBuilder.build()
} catch {
    // Possible errors that could be thrown here are NetworkingError.buildingURL and NetworkingError.encoding(error:)
}
```

### Calling requests

There are two options with which to make the actual network request.

The first option is using plain `URLRequest`.
```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.get.request.com")!
let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url)

let caller = URLRequestCaller(decoder: JSONDecoder())
let examplePublisher: AnyPublisher<Void, NetworkingError> = caller.call(using: urlRequest) // Expects no response data as Void is specified as Output
```

The second option is using `URLRequestBuilder`.
```swift
let requestBuilder = URLRequestBuilder(
    environment: Environment.production,
    endpoint: UsersEndpoint.users,
    httpMethod: .get,
    httpHeaders: [.json, .authorization(bearerToken: "secretBearerToken")],
    httpBody: nil,
    queryParameters: nil
)

let caller = URLRequestCaller(decoder: JSONDecoder())
let examplePublisher: AnyPublisher<User, NetworkingError> = caller.call(using: requestBuilder) // Expects response data as User is specified as Output
```
Take into account that when a response data is expected, a type that conforms to `Encodable` should be specified as `Output`. Otherwise `Void`.

## Conclusion

NetworkRequester is still very young. Improvements and new functionalities will be coming. Pull requests and suggestions are very welcomed.
